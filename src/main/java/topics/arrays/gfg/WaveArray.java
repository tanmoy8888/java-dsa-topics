 *  GFG : Given an sorted array arr[] of integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place).

 *  If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.
 *
 * Note: The given array is sorted in ascending order, and modify the given array in-place without returning a new array.
